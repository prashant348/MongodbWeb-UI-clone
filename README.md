# MongoDB Web UI Clone 🌐

A **static clone** of the official MongoDB web interface built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project replicates the look and feel of MongoDB's UI, focusing on frontend design and responsiveness.  
It does not contain any backend functionality or database integration — purely a **UI/UX practice project**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to practice **frontend development skills** by cloning a real-world application interface.  
Through this, I explored:
- Structuring layouts with **HTML5**
- Styling with modern **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Transitions)
- Adding interactivity with **JavaScript**
- Building a **responsive UI** similar to production-grade apps
